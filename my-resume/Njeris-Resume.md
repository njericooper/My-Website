## Profile

Self-driven software engineer. Focused on Javascript, Python, cloud technologies, and DevOps. I'm most enthusiastic about solving problems from a full stack perspective.

## Experience

### WEB DEVELOPER, YOUTH VILLAGES | 2021-PRESENT

Building quality web sites and web apps for clients in a timely manner utilizing WordPress,
Gatsby, and MERN Stack.

Led the planning, design, development, testing, and production deployment process for a
new iteration for St. Jude’s mobile app utilizing Apple’s User Interface guidelines to set the
tone for the design system and swift. The impact of this while launching it in partnership
with Twitch totaled to $11 million raised for St. Jude.

## Skills

While I started my programming career being a polygot programmer and solving any
problem put in front of me, I have since focused the last two years on the Javascript
ecosystem and serverless technologies. My focus is on HTML, CSS, ES2015, React,
Webpack, Front End Architecture ( SMACSS, BEM, Build Tools), Design Systems, etc.

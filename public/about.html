                <p> Fascinated by computers at the young age of 9, Njeri Cooper became a paid freelance developer by the age of 15. She became well versed with basic HTML, CSS, Wordpress, and even user friendly services like Wix. After high school, she went on to enroll in Computer Engineering Management with a concentration in video game design. In her final year of college, Njeri went to San Francisco to complete a tech start up degree. After working with local businesses such as Code Crew, CLOUD901 and ALSAC/St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital, she decided to take a break from the non-profit and corporate world and start her own company to teach people the global impact and implications of software as a solution.</p>

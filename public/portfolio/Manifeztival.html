        <h3>Competitive Audi</h3>
        <p>At the time, eventbrite was a competitor. Facebook just began doing the events feature. Burning Man is an example of a sustainable event, but it did not seem that it is scalable like a franchise with more than one event happening in various locations.</p>
       <h3>industry standards</h3>
       <p>
        Hosts can create a profile for themselves or their venue. They can create profile like event pages where guests can purchase tickets, comment, and stay up to date with event changes

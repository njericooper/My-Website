                <p>Greetings and thank you for visiting my bookings page!</p>
                <p>Allow me to re-introduce myself! Iâ€™m Njeri Cooper, a self taught web developer with 10 years of freelance and tech experience.</p>
                <p>As a kid, I would build radios and computers with my dad. By the time I was 15, I was paid freelance web designer. And following high school, I enrolled in one of the top universities for engineering in my state. I have a certification in tech startups, built a few business, have had junior positions in the tech field, tried out the digital nomad life, and pivoted into becoming a front end web developer that focuses on JavaScript and usability.</p>
                <p>Half a decade in the class room as a youth tech mentor has given me a unique perspective on how todays youth learns computer science and related skills best.</p>

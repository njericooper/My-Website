        <div>
            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>The support for disaster relief starts to slow down after about 4 weeks. Keeping attention on supplying aid to charitable organizations that hit the eastern US with entertainment and self improvement</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Preliminary Brainstorm</h3>
            <p> To throw a benefit concert and handcraft the experience for attendees that care about self improvement, the environment, spirituality, etc. Partner with a charity. Take results to a seed funded or event funding service to franchise the brand so the impact can spread.</p>

            <h2>Brand and Strategy</h2>
            <p>In (a number) video mettings, we developed brand attributes, intended audience, and company goals. The goal was to have en event that met the quiteria we outlined, not to reach perfection due to a limited timeline and budget.</p>

        <div>
            <h3>Brand Attributes and Mission Statement</h3>

        </div>
        <p>Environmentally conscious festival grounds, facilities, vendors, and important causes that can be addressed by everyday people, not just polotitions or soldiers.</p>

        <h3>Competitive Audit</h3>
        <p>At the time, eventbrite was a competitor. Facebook just began doing the events feature. Burning Man is an example of a sustainable event, but it did not seem that it is scalable like a franchise with more than one event happening in various locations.</p>
       <h3>industry standards</h3>
       <p>
        Hosts can create a profile for themselves or their venue. They can create profile like event pages where guests can purchase tickets, comment, and stay up to date with event changes                                                         
       </p>
       
        <h3>Gaps</h3>
        <p>
            but a few things that were missing (or up to the host) were critical details about venue practices and artist's content/messaging. 
        </p> 
        
        <h3>Prioritization</h3> 
        (urgency and impact- how will this negatively effect our brand if we don't focus on this for our users) ####
